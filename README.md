## Title
React based Calculator

## Description
This is a calculator built using Reactjs and aims to demonstrate proficiency in basic and intermidiate React, i built it as part of a web development pathway that aims to build proficiency in fullstack web development.
I used Reactjs as i find it easier to work with the component based architecture of React, it helps me to plan out and design my projects easily.
The challenges were mainly how to implement the functionality of the calculator and getting all the buttons to function accordingly which i solved using state in React.

## How to use
This is built using npm and React so a simple installation of npm and then npm start will enable you to run the project.
